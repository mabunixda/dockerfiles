### Containers for daily usage ###

Based on the idea of [jessfraz dockerfiles](https://github.com/jessfraz/dockerfiles) i started this on my own - some images are forked by her or inspired by her work.

Most containers just make sense when you also have look into [my dotfiles](https://bitbucket.org/mabunixda/dotfiles) .dockerfunctions file.
